# :snake: Cruz Supplier

This is a simple project to test the Python features through [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) :battery:



## What is this Cruz Supplier? :star:

The Cruz Supplier is a micro crm made to show the relation between the products, orders and customers.
Following the MVT pattern, we can use Django to handle and provide the data to our frontend (template).


### Quick

### Quick start
To run the project, just clone the respository and inside of your path run the command
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```


### Motivation
I'm studying Django in my free time to improve my knowledge about this stack, I additionally have to help my team to choose the next tech stack for the new project that is coming in my current job. I'm creating some project mocks using different stacks, to identify the best choice to use in our case.\




### Conclusions

Calm down :blush: there is no silver bullet and frankly, you probably won't read the best tech choice for something, from me. It's far from more important to be able to find the right tool, be able to know all your requirements, and perhaps most importantly, be able to figure out the equilibrium between your personal feeling about the tech and the right choice.
